# DISCLAIMER

## Important Notice

The Hybrid Framework is an **architectural pattern and methodology** for combining two separate commercial products:

1. **Agno** - A rapid prototyping framework by Agno AGI
2. **Agent OS** - A production orchestration platform by Builder Methods

## Requirements

⚠️ **This framework requires access to both platforms:**
- Agno SDK and API access (https://agno.com)
- Agent OS platform access (https://buildermethods.com/agent-os)

These are **separate commercial products** with their own licensing and pricing.

## Affiliation

This project is **NOT officially affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by**:
- Agno AGI
- Builder Methods
- Any contributors to the Agno or Agent OS projects

This is an independent, community-driven framework that demonstrates how to combine these tools effectively.

## Code Examples

The code examples in this repository are **conceptual demonstrations** that:
- Show the architectural pattern and bridge concept
- Illustrate the workflow from prototype to production
- Require modification to work with actual Agno and Agent OS SDKs
- Use simulated imports where actual SDKs are not freely available

## Performance Claims

Performance improvements mentioned (10-20x faster deployment) are:
- Based on architectural efficiency of the bridge pattern
- Theoretical maximums under optimal conditions
- Dependent on specific use cases and implementations
- Not guaranteed for all scenarios

## Production Use

Before using this framework in production:
1. Obtain proper licenses for both Agno and Agent OS
2. Review and comply with both platforms' terms of service
3. Implement proper security and authentication
4. Conduct thorough testing with your specific use case
