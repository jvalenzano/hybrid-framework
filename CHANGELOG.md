## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-06

### Added

- **Initial release of the Hybrid Framework** - Revolutionary approach to AI agent development
- **Core bridge pattern implementation** connecting Agno (free/open source) and Agent OS (commercial)
- **Comprehensive documentation** with visual architecture diagrams and Mermaid charts
- **Example implementations**:
  - `agno-prototype.py` - Demonstrates free Agno agent development
  - `agent-os-config.yaml` - Production configuration for Agent OS deployment
  - `hybrid-bridge.py` - Bridge pattern implementation connecting both platforms
- **Development tools**:
  - Environment configuration template (`.env.example`)
  - Installation verification script (`test_installation.py`)
  - Quick start script (`quickstart.sh`)
  - Docker compose setup for local development
- **Project governance**:
  - Contributing guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
  - MIT License
  - Comprehensive disclaimer (`DISCLAIMER.md`)

### Documentation

- **Complete README** with executive summary and visual diagrams
- **Architecture overview** with timeline comparisons (Traditional vs Hybrid approach)
- **Phase-based implementation strategy** (Prototype → Production → Enhancement)
- **Performance & cost analysis** comparing traditional vs hybrid approaches
- **FAQ section** addressing common licensing and cost questions
- **Troubleshooting guide** for common installation and configuration issues
- **Resource links** to both Agno and Agent OS platforms
- **Clear requirements** and prerequisites section

### Technical Features

- **Bridge Pattern Architecture** - Seamless transition from free prototyping to paid production
- **Multi-platform support** - Agno (Apache 2.0) + Agent OS (Builder Methods)
- **Async/await support** - Modern Python async patterns throughout
- **Environment-based configuration** - Flexible setup for different deployment scenarios
- **Extensible design** - Framework can be adapted for other production platforms

### Important Notes

- **Licensing clarity**: Agno is completely free (Apache 2.0), Agent OS requires commercial license
- **Cost model**: Start prototyping for $0, only pay for Agent OS when ready for production
- **Architecture demonstration**: This is an independent project showing integration patterns
- **Community-driven**: Open source framework with commercial platform integration
